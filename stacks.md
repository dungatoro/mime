# Stacks

Stacks are a way to store data (the only way actually). They are represented in
`[]` just like a [[procedure]] (more on their similarity on the procedure note). 
Data can be manipulated on a stack underneath the stack pointer which itself can 
be manipulated. 

Two special operations on stacks are 'join', represented as `&` and '[[zoom]] in', 
represented as `@`.
